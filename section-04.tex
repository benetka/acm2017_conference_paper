\dummy{Poured into a goblet, the beer offers some amazing head retention and rings of white lace sticking to the glass after each sip. Good clarity, with a dull golden color. The nose contains apricots and pear, faint ground white pepper, chalky yeast and an aroma of shortbread biscuits. It's very crisp and lively with a smooth back and moderate body. Spicy phenols wrap around its dry maltiness, which is similar to crusty bread, highlighted by some pithy notes of green banana. Spicy hops, with a flare from the alcohol, provide a nice bite along with a moderate grassy bitterness. Earthy on the palate with a flash of honey-like sweetness. Yeasty and fruity undertones layer middle to end. Finishes dry.}
