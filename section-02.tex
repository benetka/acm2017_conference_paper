    \caption{Distributions of information needs per category (top 35 depicted). Bars represent information needs, the size of the bars is proportional to the number of times the information need appears for that activity ($n(i,a)$). Highlighted information needs are `operating hours' (blue), `menu' (yellow), and `airport' (red).}

\dummy{Ordered by the pint, the orange-colored beer shimmers with deep red and brown hues, and is topped with a healthy lace. The nose offers a very soft, mixed bag of spices and faint notes of pumpkin meat beneath some maltiness. The aroma is delicate at first, opening up as the beer warms. Carbonation is tight on the palate, a bit sharp. More soft and powdery spices emerge, reminiscent of the holidays. The pumpkin is subtle, with hints of starch. There's just enough malty sweetness as not to overwhelm the spicing or pumpkin, with an interesting bit of burnt sugar around the edges and, at times, suggestions of oranges.}
