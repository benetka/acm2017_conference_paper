 \dummy{Speaking of sweetness, ripe flavors of passion fruit, pineapple and candied cherries sneak in nicely. Then there's alcohol again. Oh sweet, sweet alcohol. A strong presence, warm and fumy as it vaporizes off the palate. Hop oils and raw, leafy hop tannins linger well beyond the finish, leaving a spicy, warm alcohol on the tongue and a drying malty biscuit character.\\
Smooth, thick and viscous on the palate, with a full and robust body. For a moment, its sweet and tropical, then hops rush in and tear it all to shreds! The lip-smacking hop profile roams all over the place, as a sticky pine and a slightly burnt resinous coating forms on the palate. Intensely spicy, with a big grapefruity zest and a sugary, warming alcohol that smacks you upside the head for noticing it. Malt-wise, caramel and bread flavors clamor to be heard, but the hops entangle them and draw them back into the depths of the brew, where they die. Malt flavors are there, but they add sweetness and body versus anything distinct enough to challenge the hops.\\
Malt base is even, with the taste of dark overripe stone fruits, a distinct prune edge, and rounded juiciness, not overly sweet. Light charring in the background, some burnt sugars, a touch of orange blossom honey and some steeliness. Dry toward the finish, with a lingering alcohol warmth and spice, root and earth character, and a big yeasty smack at the very end.}
