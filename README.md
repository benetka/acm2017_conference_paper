ACM 2017 Conference Paper Template (sigconf)
============
This is a custom-enhanced template for a **sigconf** conference paper according to the current (Nov, 2017) [ACM Master Article template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). The main reason for creating this template is the that it removes all unnecessary files from the original source  and jump-starts the journey to your next paper ;-).
