\dummy{We~\cite{Benetka:2017:AIN} sampled a few 12-ounce bottles of this cider, chilled down to 40 degrees. Light, fizzy bubbles rise to the top while pouring. Very pale yellow color. Low carbonation. At first glance, you might almost think this is a white wine. Smells of a blend of Pink Lady, Granny Smith and McIntosh apples; a bit buttery and musty in the back. Sulfites are very hard to detect. Very light body, very white-wine-ish. Tartness leads the way, soft but with a bite. Light, earthen notes; apple skin and apple pulp, middle to back. Sweet and sour apple flavor in the middle. Kiss of warmth from the alcohol. Wet and refreshing; almost too drinkable. At 6 percent alcohol by volume, any more than a few glasses will make you loopy\footnote{\url{https://breue.com/beer_ipsum}}.}
