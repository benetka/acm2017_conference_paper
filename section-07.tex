\dummy{Body is light, and the mouthfeel smooth. The palate gathers apple peel, light clove notes and a thin sweetness that's touched with caramel. In the middle, ripe and juicy fresh wheat malt with pear edge, while a husky, grainy, wheat twang livens things up. Suggestions of bubblegum are noted. There's very little bitterness, but a slight lemony sourness, banana pith and light hop leaf character that, combined, increase the perceived bitterness. Yeast is rather neutral, a bit chalky. Some medicinal phenols show through toward the finish. Finish dries the palate, with a lingering wheat and barley husk.}
